Design Programming
## QUIZ8
1. __Part1 Imaging Technique Inspiration__
2. __Part2 Coding Technique Exploration__

### Imaging Technique Inspiration
- __Procedural Graphics-Particle art__
  - Inspired by sand painting, traditional Chinese landscape scrolls, and particle art exhibition I've seen before
  - Flowing, granular, vibrant, extending, collage and combination, orderly repetition
  - I want to learn the combination, layout and theme communication of particle elements in 2D visual design, and the particle based amazing animation effects in 3D interactive design. Particle art can have a huge space for design and development that combines time, acoustics or user triggering, and it itself has a strong beauty of randomness. Whether adding particles or particle images, particles have strong operability and controllability.

### Coding Technique Exploration
- __3d-particle-mofing__
  - It helps to add randomly floating particle swarm or particle morphology to visual design to enhance the sense of granular and extending of image, simultaneously increasing the awesome visual impact brought by the use of numourous particles.

- __p5js-particle-flowfield__
  - On the basis of the randomly distributed 2d particles, this technique further enables animation effects. It can be used to form a rich combination of multivariate dynamic effects such as order and disorder, monochrome and random colors, fast and slow, multi frame rate and stop frame etc. in the process of creative coding.

#### Other techniques that might also help
- __Procedurally-generated vector-format infinitely-scrolling Chinese landscape for the browser__
  - It helps to represent the flowing and extending sense of lines and stokes in Chinese traditional painting and can be apploed to recreate other art works.
